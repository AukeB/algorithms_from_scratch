# Wave Function Collapse

## General

## Definitions

- **Bitmap**: Your input image, that serves as the source image from which $NxN$ patters are extracted. A bitmap is a type of memory organization or image file format used to stored digital images. It consists of a rectangular grid of pixels, where each pixel reperesents a color or shade. This description sound similar to a 'normal' image. However, originally a bitmap reffered to a binary image, where each pixel was either black or white (1-bit per pixel), in that sense it really is a map of bits. It is often used referring to uncompressed, or minimally processed data. In practice, bitmap often refers to any raster image, meaning an image made of pixels rather than vectors. It can also store multiple bits per pixel (8-bit grayscale, 24-bit color or 32-bit with alpha layer).
